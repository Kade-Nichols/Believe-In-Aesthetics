            What's up you sick kunts. I'm Kade Nichols and welcome to Believe In Aesthetics. Like many of you I've struggled with some body 
            issues. I hate this word, but I grew up with an "ectomorphic" physique. Small frame with a struggle to gain 
            strength and size. After spinning my wheels for a couple years I had enough. I had read all the time guys 
            jumping on some anabolics and blowing the hell up. I love the shit out of bodybuilding so I said fuck it
            and dove right in deep end.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wrote up a high volume high frequency program, ate everything in sight, and added 600mg Testosterone each
            week with a little dbol straight to the dome. Appetite shot up, lifting is fucking euphoric, and strength 
            went up each workout. I finished the cycle off with some Trenbolone and god damn it's as crazy as they say. Sex drive goes up,
            new veins each day, and pumped up all the fucking time. I was on cloud-9. I gained combined with water, glycogen, and tissue a total of 40 pounds.
            Roughly 2.5lbs a week.
          </p>

            <p>
              I love the aesthetic movement and how the industry is evolving. I don't like all the fakes and bullshit
              supplement promotions scamming young guys and selling fake dreams. I know I will catch a lot of flack for 
              posting my story and experience, but I don't want to be another fake fitness persona. Our individuality
              is to be embraced. 
            </p>
            <p>
              People will talk and talk and say "oh, steroids, steroids." But they didn't see how many meals I was putting down. They
              didn't see the 2+ hour training sessions every single day. Anabolics are great, but without a solid diet,
              training protocol, and care to one's health, it's just bloat in a vial. Moral of the story bro's is train
              hard, eat to your goals, and don't give a fuck what anyone thinks! Live YOUR life!
            </p>
